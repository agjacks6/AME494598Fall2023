 <h1>Tutorial</h1>
  
  <h2>Step 1:</h2>
    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
      <p>Start by creating an EC2 server on AWS by pressing the EC2 button on the home screen. 
      Then, go to the Instances (running) page and select the orange "Launch Instances" button in the right corner of the page.</p>

   <h2>Step 2:</h2>
        <h3>Start the Instance</h3>
          <p>Once you press the "Launch Instances" button, you will open a page with several different settings for your page. 
            Here, you should change the OS to Ubuntu. Select Unbuntu Server 20.04 as the Amazon Machine Image. Under Key pair, you are able
            to add a key pair to your server. However, for the sake of this assignment, select "Proceed without a key pair". Under configuration, 
            change 1x 8 to 1x 28. From there you can select the "Launch Instance" button on the bottom of the page. </p>

            <h2>Step 3:</h2>
            <h3>Security Codes</h3>
              <p>After the instance is launched, go to the Instances page and select your newly created Instance. Scroll down and select the Security button.
              From there, select the <b>launch wizard</b> button under the <b>Security groups</b> heading. Go into the inbound rules section and press 
              <b>Edit Inbound Rules</b>. Add two new rules by pressing the <b>add rule</b> button and change the port range on both. One should be 8080, and the 
              other should be 
              </p>
