Our project takes the form of a magic 8 ball style fortune teller, using a webpage as well as the physical button that can
be connected to the watch. When someone presses the button conencted to the watch, the watch and the webpage will display
a response which is chosen through a random number generator-esque line of code. To add a a=layer of interactivity, the user
can type in a yes or no question into a text box on the webpage before pressing the button.
